# Task 7: Apply Triggers in Build and Release
## Objective:
### Configure automated triggers so that changes to the master branch start a complete pipeline that includes both build and release stages, ensuring consistent and continuous integration and deployment.

## Actions Taken
1.  Created a multi-stage YAML pipeline in azure-pipelines.yml with:

- Build Stage:

  - Runs automatically on commits to master.

  - Simulates building the application with echo steps.

- Release Stage:

  - Configured with dependsOn: Build to start automatically when the Build stage completes successfully.

  - Simulates deployment actions with echo steps.

2. Pipeline YAML configuration:

```bash
trigger:
- master

pool:
  name: Default   # your self-hosted agent pool name

stages:
- stage: Build
  displayName: 'Build Stage'
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    displayName: 'Run Build Job'
    steps:
    - script: echo "Building the application..."
      displayName: 'Build step'
    - script: echo "Simulating artifact creation..."
      displayName: 'Create artifact step'

- stage: Release
  displayName: 'Release Stage'
  dependsOn: Build   # runs after Build stage completes
  jobs:
  - job: ReleaseJob
    displayName: 'Run Release Job'
    steps:
    - script: echo "Deploying the application..."
      displayName: 'Deployment step'
    - script: echo "Release complete!"
      displayName: 'Confirmation step'

```
3.  Configured triggers with:

```bash
trigger:
- master
```
 This ensures the pipeline starts automatically on every commit to master.

4. Tested and verified the pipeline:

- Committed the updated azure-pipelines.yml to a feature branch.

- Created a pull request to merge into master.

- Confirmed that the pipeline ran automatically with both stages (Build and Release) executed sequentially.

## Summary
### By creating a multi-stage pipeline triggered on master, I successfully applied triggers in both build and release processes, fulfilling the assignmentâ€™s requirements for Task 7. The pipeline now automatically builds and deploys the application on every commit to the master branch.
